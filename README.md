# flick-organizer
Flickr organizer written in Python originally for personal use. 

I have used these scripts to maintain my Flickr albums once I migrated from Google to Flickr.

TODO:
* Refactorize the code so that the code could be reusable by someone else too.
* Use local database like sqlite3 instead of MySQL db.
* Create documentation
